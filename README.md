# WorkFlowBot
A work flow bot made for the Arcturus Game DEV group server

Made with some help and input from members of the server

# Why is this written in python ?

1) To make it easier to host 

2) Most people in the group understand or can easily understand python

3) Speed is not much of an concern considering all the other layers invoved as well as the lack of heavy processing this bot has to do

4) To get the code out and finished ASAP rather than spending so much time on this side project (both for me and the group as a whole)
